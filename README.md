- Click the more vertical icon on the user table to view each user details on dashboard.
- Toggle the button with inverted carret icon below the table to see filter modal **modal for filter not functional yet**
- For pagination use prev, next and 1, 2 **this are the properly functioning buttons.

# issues
Do not use the last two buttons with the higher number values (the next button works perfectly and can be used) of the pagination. it is still in development. doing this will mess up your table layout.
The bug will be fixed in next commit.
